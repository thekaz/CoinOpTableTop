## Characters have 6 stats:

**Combat:**
Used for fighting, violence, hitting things

**Coordination:**
Used for maneuvering, evasion, sneaking, movement

**Constitution:**
Used for resilience, ability to withstand, health

**Cognition:**
Used for logical thinking, figuring things out, solving problems

**Common Sense:**
Used for snap judgements, instinctual feelings, reading situations

**Cooperation:**
Used for interactions between people/beings, likability

## Coin system:
- Instead of dice or cards, players use coin flips to determine success/failure.
- When a player attempts to take an action, the GM decides which stat will be used for that action and the difficulty.
- The difficulty of a task is a single number between 1 and 7. The challenged player must achieve that many “heads” flips 
- The + stat bonuses force “heads” results for the bonus amount. So, a player with +2 in Common Sense attempting a Common Sense challenge rating of 4 would have their first 2 coin flips be automatically heads and would need 2 more heads in the remaining 5 coin flips.
- The - stat penalties force “tails” results for the penalty amount. So a player with -1 in Combat attempting a Combat challenge rating of 3 would have their first coin flip automatically be tails and would need 2 more heads in the remaining 6 coin flips.

## Difficulty Ranges:
**Percentages are assuming no penalties/bonuses**

1 -> trivial (99%)\
2 -> simple (93%)\
3 -> easy (77%)\
4 -> a coin flip (50%)\
5 -> difficult (23%)\
6 -> epic (6%)\
7 -> legendary (<1%)

## Recommendations:
- During character creation, allow players to allocate permanent bonuses/penalties to their stats adding to a total of +2 overall (sum of bonuses minus penalties)
- Implement a help mechanic where a character can provide another character with a bonus after the helping character completes a skill challenge of their own
- Use a gradient for passing/failing a challenge whereby the amount by which a challenge is met/failed changes the severity of the in-world result.
- This system is designed for one-shots or mini campaigns, as it doesn’t really have a progression system
- Additionally, this system is designed primarily around role play/storytelling and is best used for combat-light campaigns

## Math for nerds 🤓:
Modifier is the left header, DC is the top header, percentage is the percent chance to succeed. As you can see, this leads to a non-linear success curve that is closer to the bell curve than any d20 system.
